## Quick Start
The installation script will automatically generate a local configuration file  "admin/local.py". In case the file was not generated, run ```admin.environment.create_default_local_file()``` to generate it. Next, set the paths to the training workspace, 
i.e. the directory where the checkpoints will be saved. Also set the paths to the datasets you want to use. If all the dependencies have been correctly installed, you can train a network using the run_training.py script in the correct conda environment.  
```bash
conda activate pytracking
python run_training.py train_module train_name
```
Here, ```train_module``` is the sub-module inside ```train_settings``` and ```train_name``` is the name of the train setting file to be used.

For example, you can train using the included default ATOM settings by running:
```bash
python run_training.py bbreg atom_default
```


## Overview
The framework consists of the following submodules.

## Trackers
 The framework currently contains the training code for the following trackers.

### RTS
 Three steps are required to train RTS:
 - Download [lasot_got10k_pregenerated_masks.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17YcdQOoA4DubK-krClJfxNtw9ooCyWHv/view?usp=sharing).

   Unzip the archive in the `pregenerated_masks` set in `ltr/admin/local.py`.
 - Download the pretrained LWL weights [lwl_stage2.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xnm4A2BRBliDBKO4EEFHAQfGyfOMsVyY/view?usp=sharing).

   Save the weights in the `pretrained_networks` set in `ltr/admin/local.py`.
 - Use this setting for training with ResNet50 backbone: [rts.rts50](train_settings/rts/rts50.py)


### ToMP
 The following setting files can be used to train the ToMP tracker. We omit training with a separate test encoding since the training is more stable but leads to comparable performance. Set the flag to false to use the same setup as in the paper.
 - [tomp.tomp50](train_settings/tomp/tomp50.py): The default setting use for training with ResNet50 backbone. 
 - [tomp.tomp101](train_settings/tomp/tomp101.py): The default setting use for training with ResNet101 backbone.

### KeepTrack
 In order to train KeepTrack the following three steps are required.  
 - Prepare the base tracker: Download the weights [super_dimp_simple.pth.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzwdeX9HBefQwznMaX5AKAGda7tqeQtg) or retrain the tracker using the settings [dimp.super_dimp_simple](train_settings/dimp/super_dimp_simple.py).  
 - Prepare the training dataset: Download [target_candidates_dataset_dimp_simple_super_dimp_simple.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIlrYYpkYKAtZyNzkwUCaqAxYyMNC27S) or re-create the dataset by switching to `../pytracking/util_scripts` and running [create_distractor_dataset](../pytracking/util_scripts/create_distractor_dataset.py) using `python create_distractor_dataset.py dimp_simple super_dimp_simple lasot_train $DATASET_DIR`. Add the path of the dataset file to the `local.py` file.  
 - Train KeepTrack using the settings [keep_track.keep_track](train_settings/keep_track/keep_track.py) using super_dimp_simple as base tracker.  

### LWL
 The following setting files can be used to train the LWL networks, or to know the exact training details.   
 - [lwl.lwl_stage1](train_settings/lwl/lwl_stage1.py): The default settings used for initial network training with fixed backbone weights. We initialize the backbone ResNet with pre-trained Mask-RCNN weights. These weights can be obtained from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12pVHmhqtxaJ151dZrXN1dcgUa7TuAjdA/view?usp=sharing). Download and save these weights in `env_settings().pretrained_networks` directory.  
 - [lwl.lwl_stage2](train_settings/lwl/lwl_stage2.py): The default settings used for training the final LWL model. This setting fine-tunes all layers in the model trained using [lwl_stage1](train_settings/lwl/lwl_stage1.py).   
 - [lwl.lwl_boxinit](train_settings/lwl/lwl_boxinit.py):  The default settings used for training the bounding box encoder network in order to enable VOS with box initialization.

## Training your own networks
To train a custom network using the toolkit, the following components need to be specified in the train settings. For reference, see [atom.py](train_settings/bbreg/atom.py).  
- Datasets: The datasets to be used for training. A number of standard tracking datasets are already available in ```dataset``` module.  
- Processing: This function should perform the necessary post-processing of the data, e.g. cropping of target region, data augmentations etc.  
- Sampler: Determines how the frames are sampled from a video sequence to form the batches.  
- Network: The network module to be trained.  
- Objective: The training objective.  
- Actor: The trainer passes the training batch to the actor who is responsible for passing the data through the network correctly, and calculating the training loss.  
- Optimizer: Optimizer to be used, e.g. Adam.  
- Trainer: The main class which runs the epochs and saves checkpoints.
